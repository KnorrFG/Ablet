# Ablet

This is ablet, a crate to create TUIs with very little effort.
It's inspired by [Matklad's design for Abont](https://github.com/matklad/abont).
However, instead of building an interpreter, or a shell, this is simply
a library that follows the same ideas.

It's not ready to be presented yet. Come back later
